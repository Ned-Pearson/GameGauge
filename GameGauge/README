TODO:

- Individual game page - placeholder areas for logging

  - Displays, Cover image, Game name, release year, studio, genres, platforms, "plot" summary, cover art. etc

- Logging functionality - integrated into game page

  - Saves users "status" (Want to play / backlog, playing, completed, dropped)
  - User can only log a game once, can edit previous log
  - Create an individual users logs page
    - Displays all of a users logs

- Review functionality - Similar to log but includes rating and review text

  - Doesnt have a status (assumes games rated and reviewed after completion)
  - Individual users reviews page

- User following functionality

  - Update users table to have following and followers per user
  - Add a members section / members search
  - Display member profile - displays their logs and reviews
  - Has a follow button

- Front page extension

  - Implement the 3 popular display pages on the front end
  - Due to website likely not being widely used, have the weekly popular functionality but don't update unless there is something new to replace it (just to avoid the areas becoming blank)

- Misc todos

  - Trim whitespace on username is signup + signin
  - Add a forgot password feature to signin
  - Refactor code and remove duplicate code and unnecessary code
    (Best practise would be to do as I go I know but trying to get functionality done quickly to have something to show in job interviews)
  - Clear .env file from the github history (Shouldnt have pushed in the first place)
